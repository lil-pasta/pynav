#+TITLE: File Manager Outline
#+DATE: 4/16/2020

* Introduction and Purpose
The purpose of this application is create a console based file manager application which allows for the in-terminal navigate of my own linux machine. The application should be fast, intuitive, portable, and feature rich. The program will feature python code leveraging builtin packages like ncurses and os.
* Features
** Minimum functionality:
1. Start program in a specified dir or in $HOME (or some other default)
2. View the current directory in a screen
3. On highlighting a file if it is:
   a. directory: show the contents of that dir
   b. file: show metadata (name, file type, size, etc.) in a well formatted manner
4. On some key press (maybe enter?) take appropriate actions related to the highlighted object like
   + Navigating into the highlighted directory
   + opening the highlighted file using a relevant program (like a text editor for text programs... stuff like that)
5. basic file manipulation operations:
   + copying file(s) to a new location
   + moving file(s)
   + deleting file(s)
6. Show files and directories differently
7. Allowing user specified sorting of items (like by size or by alphabet or by type)
* Roadmap
** [0/3] Crawling
+ [ ] Get all files and folders in working dir
+ [ ] Add them to a dict or list or class with relevant meta-data attached
+ [ ] Print them to terminal and make them high-light-able (curse)
+ [ ]
