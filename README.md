# Introduction and Purpose

The purpose of this application is create a console based file manager application which allows for the in-terminal navigation of a nix based machine. 
The program features python code leveraging builtin packages like ncurses and os. The initial idea for this was inspired by applications like lfm and a desire to learn more about GUI/TUI programming.
